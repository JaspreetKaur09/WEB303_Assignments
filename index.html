                            <h3>Early Life and Career</h3>
                        </button>
                        <p class="accordion-panel">
                        Khan was born into a Punjabi Muslim family family in Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan, in 1948.
                        His family originates from Basti Sheikh Darvesh, who settled in Jalandhar, Punjab in
                        present-day India.His ancestors learned music and singing there and adopted it as a profession.He was the
                        fifth child and first son of Fateh Ali Khan, a musicologist, vocalist, instrumentalist, and
                        qawwal. Khan's family,which included four older sisters and a younger brother, <strong><em>Farrukh Fateh
                        Ali Khan</em></strong>,grew up in central Faisalabad.The tradition of qawwali in the
                        family had passed down through successive generations for almost 600 years.Initially, his father did not want Khan
                        to follow the family's vocation. He had his heart set on Nusrat choosing a much more respectable career path and becoming a doctor or
                        engineer because he felt qawwali artists had low social status. However, Khan showed such an aptitude
                        for and interest in qawwali, that his father finally relented.
                        In 1971, after the death of his uncle Mubarak Ali Khan, Khan became the official leader of
                        the family qawwali party and the party became known as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Mujahid
                        Mubarak Ali Khan & Party.Khan's first public performance as the leader of the qawwali party was at a studio
                        recordingbroadcast as part of an annual music festival organized by Radio Pakistan, known as Jashn-e-Baharan. Khan sang
                        mainly in Urdu and Punjabi and occasionally in Persian, Braj Bhasha and Hindi. His first major hit in Pakistan
                        was the song Haq Ali Ali, which was performed in a traditional style and with traditional instrumentation.
                        The song featured restrained use of Khan's sargam improvisations.
